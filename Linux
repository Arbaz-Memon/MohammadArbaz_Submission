# 5). Linux:
Q5.1) create a new folder “test_new” in the home directory.
To cerate a new folder we usew mkdir ‘

mkdir ~/test_new


Q5.2) remove all permissions of the “test_new” directory.
To remove all Permissins of the directory We use :

chmod 000 ~/test_new


Q5.3) create a “new.txt” file in the “test_new” directory. (with Q5.2, without making changes to permission)
Since here all permissions are remove then we use root case:

sudo touch ~/test_new/new.txt

 
Q5.4) delete the “test_new” directory. (with Q5.2, without making changes to permission)
Here also all permissions of test_new was remove then here also we use root case :

sudo rm -rf ~/test_new
